## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database
- Git

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Tapsy-backend-Node.git
   cd Tapsy-backend-Node
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Tapsy-backend-Node.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   ```

2. Configure your database and other environment variables in `.env.development`

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Push database schema (development)
npm run db:dev:deploy

# Run migrations (development)
npm run db:dev:migrate

# Seed database (optional)
npm run db:dev:seed
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Branching Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow approach:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Ensure you're on develop and up-to-date
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create and checkout a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-description
```

## Creating a Pull Request

### 1. Prepare Your Changes

Before creating a PR, ensure your code follows our standards:

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lint:fix

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm run test

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Format code if needed
npm run format
```

### 2. Commit Your Changes

Follow our commit message convention:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint

- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add login and register endpoints
- Include input validation and error handling
- Add comprehensive test coverage"
```

### 3. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Create the Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request" for your feature branch
3. Fill out the PR template (see below)

### 5. PR Template

Use this template when creating your PR:

```markdown

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper typing for all functions and variables
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown`

### Code Style

- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### File Organization

- Controllers in `src/controllers/`
- Services in `src/services/`
- Routes in `src/routes/`
- Middleware in `src/middlewares/`
- Types in `src/types/`
- Utils in `src/utils/`

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Unit tests in `src/__tests__/unit/`
- Integration tests in `src/__tests__/integration/`
- Test files should end with `.test.ts`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Requirements

- All new features must have corresponding tests
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Tests should be independent and repeatable
- Use descriptive test names

## Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add JWT authentication middleware
fix(user): resolve user creation validation issue
docs(api): update API documentation
test(auth): add authentication integration tests
```
