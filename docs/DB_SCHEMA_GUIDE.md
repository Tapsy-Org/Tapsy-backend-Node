ðŸ”‘ How to deal with Prisma migration conflicts
1. Agree on a workflow

The most important rule: Only one person should generate migrations at a time.

Developer A: changes schema.prisma â†’ runs prisma migrate dev â†’ commits both schema.prisma and the new migration folder.

Developer B: pulls â†’ runs prisma migrate dev â†’ Prisma applies Aâ€™s migration to their local DB.

That way, migrations are applied in the same order for everyone.

2. If both of you made schema changes

This is where conflicts happen. Options:

Option A â€” Merge carefully

Both devs commit their migrations.

On pull, Prisma will replay migrations in timestamp order.

If they touch the same column/table, youâ€™ll hit errors like you just saw (column already exists).
â†’ One of you needs to manually merge migrations (edit SQL) so the DB isnâ€™t trying to create duplicate fields.

Option B â€” Reset and rebase (dev-only)

If youâ€™re still in development and donâ€™t care about losing local data:

Delete all migration folders.

Keep only your latest schema.prisma.

Run:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init


This creates a single clean migration.

Push this to Git.

Teammates reset their DB and re-apply.

3. In Production

Never delete or rewrite migration history.

Instead, resolve by editing the failing migration manually (steps.sql) or by creating a new migration to fix conflicts.

4. Practical Team Guidelines

âœ… Always commit both schema.prisma and the migration folder together.
âœ… Never edit an old migration thatâ€™s already merged.
âœ… Use npx prisma migrate dev locally after every pull.
âœ… If conflicts keep happening in dev â†’ agree to squash into a fresh migration baseline regularly.
